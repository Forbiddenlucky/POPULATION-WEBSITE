        Overpopulation or overabundance is a phenomenon in which a species' population becomes larger than the carrying capacity of its environment.
         This may be caused by increased birth rates, lowered mortality rates, reduced predation or large scale migration, leading to an 
         overabundant species and other animals in the ecosystem competing for food, space, and resources. 
        The animals in an overpopulated area may then be forced to migrate to areas not typically inhabited, or die off without access to necessary
         resources.Judgements regarding overpopulation always involve both facts and values. Animals often are judged overpopulated when their 
         numbers cause impacts that people find dangerous, damaging, expensive, or otherwise harmful. Societies may be judged overpopulated when their human numbers cause impacts that degrade ecosystem services, decrease human health and well-being, 
         or crowd other species out of existence.

        In ecology, overpopulation is a concept used primarily in wildlife management.Typically, an overpopulation causes the 
        entire population of the species in question to become weaker, as no single individual is able to find enough food or shelter. 
        As such, overpopulation is thus characterized by an increase in the diseases and parasite-load which live upon the species in question, 
        as the entire population is weaker. Other characteristics of overpopulation are lower fecundity, adverse effects on the environment 
        (soil, vegetation or fauna) and lower average body weights.Especially the worldwide increase of deer populations, which usually show irruptive 
        growth, is proving to be of ecological concern. Ironically, where ecologists were preoccupied with conserving or augmenting deer populations only a 
        century ago, the focus has now shifted in the direct opposite, and ecologists are now more concerned with limiting the populations of such animals.

      <h3>Problems faced due to population</h3>
      <ol type="I">
        <li><h4>Unemployment</h4>
          <p>
            An article that has recently been written has caused me some thought and compelled me to my very own theory and conclusion. 
            It questions how government can create hordes of jobs whilst retrenching on the other hand. Essentially the two cancel each other out.
            Similar concept to resuscitating a patient whilst pulling out the plug for his life support machine. Or perhaps as Bruno Mars put it “You'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car”.
            Whoever you are and however you look at it, it’s blatant duplicity and does not make any rational sense at all.
            I am going to offer my theory as to the real cause of unemployment followed by the illogical solution versus the logical solution:
            For every cause there is an effect. The process of cause and effect.
            Unemployment is the result of too many people, too few jobs. In other words, unemployment is the result of overpopulation because overpopulation is defined as a condition where a country’s 
            human population exceeds the carrying capacity of its environment meaning in this case that the populace is more than the amount of available or needed jobs.
            Now that we have concluded the effect of overpopulation we can move onto the cause:
            Overpopulation is directly linked to excessive sexual activity resulting in reproduction in conjunction with a lack of birth control and a lack of adequate family planning.
            Let us look at a classic case:
            A woman living in a township in a shack that is not big enough to house herself, her three teenage kids and toddler and cannot afford to put her children through school and does not earn enough money to provide enough food to feed her family decides to have unprotected intercourse with her boyfriend and inevitably falls pregnant with her 5th child and subsequent burden.
            The above is not only an example of the absence of birth control but rather a much more severely damaging result of the inability to family plan.
            Family planning is the ability and knowledge of how to control reproduction and having as many babies as can be supported.
            Now that we have concluded the effect of inadequate family planning we can move onto the cause:
            Education is essential in learning the skills required in basic human survival and development such as calculation, economics, biological understanding and also planning such things as budgets and families.
            Unfortunately our rural schools are in such bad conditions that this basic right is unavailable to the majority of the ethnic community. Hence the lack of family planning, hence the cause of overpopulation, hence the cause of unemployment.

        <li><h4>Lack of food</h4>
            <p>
              Many countries worldwide are facing the threat of growing food insecurity reversing the gains attained over the decades in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Even before the pandemic, 
              poverty and hunger have been on the rise due to climate change, disasters, locus ts, conflict situations, etc. 
              In the past two years, with the loss of livelihoods and disruption in the food supply chain along with lockdowns, the situation has only worsened. 
              The Ukraine war has added to the rising food insecurity and scare of food crisis with price inflation and disruption in the food supply chain, pushing millions into acute hunger.
              Many countries worldwide are facing the threat of growing food insecurity reversing the gains attained over the decades in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
              The pandemic and the war have led to a rise in inflation around the world with looming food and energy prices.  According to the World Bank,  all countries irrespective of the income level have been hit by a price rise of more than 5 percent—most affected are 94 percent of low-income countries and not to spare 70 percent of high-income countries. 
              As per the 2022 Commodity Markets Outlook, the war has transformed trade, production and consumption causing the price rise thus aggravating food insecurity and inflation. A rise in energy prices pushes the agricultural and production cost leading to higher food prices.
              World food prices have jumped by 20.7 percent year after year leading to a surge in inflation. The war has aggravated the food price to 40 percent and the combined effect of the pandemic, climate change is reversing the global trends in reducing hunger and malnutrition. 
              In the regions already affected by drought and famines, the prices rise and the food crisis is at its worst. Even the high-income food-secure countries such as the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) are having an impact of cost inflation due to food insecurity. 
              The situation is similar to the 2007-08 world food crisis that led to economic instability, food shortage, and price rise.
              The 2022 Global Report on Food Crises shows an alarming level of hunger with 193 million people facing food insecurity due to conflicts, economic shock, and weather extremes.

        <li><h3>Crime rates</h3>
        <p>
          Overpopulation is the most urgent problem that we face now and in the future.
          There are more people in America right now than there were in the whole world at the .
          time of the birth of Christ, just two thousand years ago (Brown and Liu, 1999). Many of .
          the world's problems such as poverty, crime, pollution and the destruction of our .
          environment is linked to the unchecked growth of the human population.
          It has been found that the less space people have to live in, the harder it is for .
          them to get along. As people compete, not only for housing but also for food, jobs, and .
          schooling, the more hostile their behavior becomes. Crime, and a lack of respect for .
          other people, becomes more common as the space around you is reduced (Coleman,1990; .
          Agnew,1992,1999). Violence is more prevalent in highly populated areas, as are other .
          forms of criminal behavior. A possible explanation is due to aggression and anxiety .
          brought on by an overpopulated environment.
          Over the years, Sociologists and Criminologists have investigated factors related .
          to crime rate. Social Disorganization Theory, Relative Deprivation and Subculture .
          Deviance Theory, and General Strain Theory are several contending theories. These .
          theories contend that community level variables, such as density and overcrowding, are .
          among the factors directly or indirectly contributing to crime through reducing social .
          control and/or increasing strain (Wirth, 1938; Coleman, 1990; Agnew, 1992, 1999). .
          some studies found that population density, housing quality, and overcrowding are.
          not predictors of crime and other problems of poor neighborhoods (Wilner, 1962; .
          Burns, 1970; Choldin, 1978). Still others studies suggest that high density has harmful .

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Problem of overpopulation is real and should be paid attention to. Overpopulation leads to a lot of problems ranging from lack of resources ,
        loss of biodiversity, unemployment, more crime rates, etc.However, there are numerous ways to tackle this difficulty and make a world a compact 
        and useful place to live in where ech person has good amount of resources, lives a happy life and there are no risks that the future generation will 
        to face. Best way to start is to have proper education regarding sexual topics, the need of good contraceptive methods and some provoking schemes 
        by the government to help reduce the population growth.
